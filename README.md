kave no-sql database

Kave stands for key-attribute-value-entity. The logical model is an extension of the key-value model.
The kave model enriches the semantics of the key-value model by adding further descriptors, namely an entity and an attribute. Furthermore, the value descriptor can store a multi-value.

Kave is an in-memory system for a faster management of data. The underlying data structure is based on a java hash-map.
